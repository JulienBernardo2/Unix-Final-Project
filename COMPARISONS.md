# Solution Comparisons 
   _This file is to explain the different resasons why we chose one solution over another_

# Intial Choices
   ## OVHCloud over Digital Ocean
   For the VPS, we decided to go with OVHcloud over DigitalOcean. Each VPS has their own qualities, 
   but OVH is a better deal. OVHcloud virtual private server is good because it has a decent price and 
   offers a better protection than other. The main pros and cons between OVHcloud and DigitalOcean are shown in the picture below:

   ## Linux terminal over Windows terminal
   Initially we did believe that the Linux terminal would have been the easiest option when running all of our commands and working on
   the project due to us using the terminal throughout the whole semester. We know most commands for Linux and have a better general
   understanding of the terminal.
   
   ## Nginx over Apache
   We decided to choose Nginx over Apache because we researched the differences and noticed that Ngninx is much faster than the
   Apache web server. Another reason for using Nginx over Apache was that we had already added a website to the Nginx server in
   one of our labs so we knew the general understanding on how to make it work.
   
   ## Debian over Ubuntu
   Originally we had decided to use debian over Ubuntu because the whole semester we have been using Debian an we are farely 
   used to navigating the system. With this in mind we also had a Virtual System already running with Debian so to create 
   another Virtual System with Ubuntu would have been very time consuming on our part. 
   
## After Completing the project

   ## VPS choice
   After completing this project we ended up regretting our choice with OVHCloud. It was very difficult to navigate and 
   see how to actually do the tasks that we wanted done. Nonetheless, we did notice that Digital Ocean was easier to navigate
   and was also more user friendly. Also Digital Ocean had a 1 time free domain option which would have been
   useful for this project. So overall Digital Ocean seems like the better choice after completing our project.
   
   ## Windows Terminal and Putty
   When we first started the project we seemed to have a lot of problems with logging into our VPS from Linux due to our
   intitial username and password not working. Therefore we looked for some solutions which led us to use the Putty application
   because it actually let us access our VPS. We know that there are other solutions for this problem, but Putty was the easiest
   one. Also we noticed that we could download git bash to get all of the Linux commands on Windows so this inticed us even more
   to use Putty.
   
   ## Nginx
   We still ended up using the Nginx web server and succesfully adding our website to our VPS with it.
