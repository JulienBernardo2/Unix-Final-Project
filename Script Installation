First thing is to do is to to set up your github repository
Follow this guide 
After finishing your repository, go back to vps
This time we are going to copy the public keys we created earlier and paste on github
cat âˆ¿/ .ssh/id_rsa.pub, copy ths key and go to your github repository
Click settings > look for deploy keys on the left side > click add deploy key on the top right
Give it a proper name and paste your key then click Add key
Now go back to VPS
Let's create the script sudo nano /usr/bin/deploy.sh. Add the following.

#!/bin/bash
cd /var/www/IP_ADDRESS
git fetch --all 
git checkout --force "origin/main"




First line is to make sure we are in the right directory.
Second line gets all the dat afrom the github repo without merging or rebassing
Third line using the optional command force to make sure that any changes that happens will be applied to the local repository as well
Save the file and add permission, sudo chmod 777 /usr/bin/ deploy.sh sudo chmode +x /usr/ bin/deploy.sh
Then we create our services:
First is the service to start our script.
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/deployment.service. Add the following.

[Unit]
Description= add your description

[service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/deploy.sh

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target




Save the file and add permission again.
And for the last trick, we are going to craete another service.
A timer that runs the script every 15 seconds 
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/deployment.timer IMPORTANT make sure you named it the same way as your other service 

[Unit]
Description=add your description

[Timer]
OnUnitActiveSec = 15 sec
OnBootSec=10

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target



Save the file and add permission
Last time is to make the service functional
Let's start with the deployment.services

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable deployment.service
sudo systemctl start deployment.service
sudo systemctl status deployment.service to see if the srevice is active and running if not,
make sure you did not misspelled anything and you added permissions
Next is deployment.timer

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable deployment.timer 
sudo systemctl start deployment.timer 
sudo systemctl status deployment.timer

Now all changes you make you make on github should applied automatically on your vps
The script runs every 15secs to check if there any changes made
